# SnowChess

SnowChess is a simple boilerplate for chess applications in C#. It contains a main board, defined standard pieces (and an easy way to create custom pieces) and presents intuitive methods to handle the action in the game.

This is mostly to teach myself, someone who's never worked on anything related to computer chess, the complexities involved. I'd like to make an engine on top of this one day.
